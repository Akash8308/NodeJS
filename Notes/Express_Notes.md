Got it 👍 Your **ExpressJS notes** are good already — I’ll polish them into a **cheat sheet format** like the others (React, Node, EJS), fix small wording, and expand the **HTTP status codes** into proper categories (instead of “funny” placeholders, but I’ll keep them in a fun version too if you like 😄).

# 📘 Express.js Notes

## 🔹 What is Express.js?

- **Express.js** is a minimal and flexible **Node.js framework** for building backend applications and APIs.
- Handles **HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and responses**.

---

## 🔹 HTTP Methods in Express

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **GET** | Retrieve resource (read data). |
| **POST** | Create new resource (send data). |
| **PUT** | Replace an existing resource completely. |
| **PATCH** | Update part of an existing resource. |
| **DELETE** | Remove a resource. |

---

## 🔹 Handling POST Requests

- To access **request body** (not query params), you need **body-parsing middleware**:

```jsx
app.use(express.json()); // parse JSON request body
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // parse form data

```

---

## 🔹 HTTP Status Codes (Cheat Sheet)

### ✅ Standard Categories

| Code | Category | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1xx** | Informational | "Hold on" – Request received, continuing process. |
| **2xx** | Success | "Here you go" – Request was successful. |
| **3xx** | Redirection | "Go away" – Resource moved, client should redirect. |
| **4xx** | Client Error | "You messed up" – Invalid request by client. |
| **5xx** | Server Error | "I messed up" – Server failed to fulfill request. |

### HTTP return codes cheat sheet

1. **1xx** → Hold on
2. **2xx** → Here you go
3. **3xx** → Go away
4. **4xx** → You fu***d up
5. **5xx** → I fu***d up

---

## 🔹 Example Express Server

```jsx
import express from "express";
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Routes
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("Hello, Express!");
});

app.post("/data", (req, res) => {
  res.status(201).json({ message: "Data received", body: req.body });
});

// Start server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});

```

---

## 🔹 Summary

- Express.js = **backend framework for Node.js**.
- Supports **CRUD operations** via HTTP methods.
- Use middleware (`express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`) to parse request bodies.
- HTTP status codes: **1xx info, 2xx success, 3xx redirect, 4xx client error, 5xx server error**.
